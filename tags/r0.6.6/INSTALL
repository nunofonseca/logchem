Installation
============

LogCHEM runs on Linux and Unix OS. To install just run the install.sh
script and add the directory you provide to your shell's PATH.

Procedure to install LogCHEM in a terminal window and assuming that you
are in the LogCHEM's root directory: 

1. ./install.sh <myinstallrootdir> (e.g., ./install.sh /usr/local) 
2. export PATH=$PATH:myrootdir/bin (e.g., export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin)

By default, the install script installs LogCHEM to the working
directory.
